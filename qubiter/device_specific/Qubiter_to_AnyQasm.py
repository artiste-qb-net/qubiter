class Qubiter_to_AnyQasm(SEO_reader):
    """
    This abstract class is a child of SEO_reader. It reads an input English
    file and writes an AnyQasm file that is a translation of the input
    English file into the AnyQasm language. If the flag write_qubiter_files
    is set to True, this class will also write new English and Picture files
    that are in 1-1 onto line correspondence with the output AnyQasm file.

    Footnote: Some AnyQasm's distinguish between quantum registers qreg and
    classical registers creg. Qubiter does not use cregs because it uses the
    classical memory of your Linux PC instead. AnyQasm has an intricate set
    of commands for measurements. Qubiter has a complete set of measurement
    commands too (see MEAS in Rosetta stone). The AnyQasm and Qubiter
    measurement commands can obviously be translated into each other. We
    leave that part of the translation to a future version of this class.

    This class can run in either a strict or a non-strict mode depending on
    the flag `strict_mode`, which equals False in default mode. In the
    strict mode, the set of gates allowed is constrained to a small but
    universal set that is specified below, and that is allowed in any target
    qasm. In the non-strict mode, more gates are allowed that depend on
    specific target qasm. In the strict mode, the program will end if you
    try to use gates that are not allowed. In the non-strict mode,
    the program will end if you try to use gates for a target language that
    have not been implemented yet in the Qubiter class targeting that
    language, often because the target language doesn't support those gates.
    
    Will refer to target qasm as AnyQasm or aqasm

    Next we give a description of the strict_mode:

    In the strict mode, the input English file that is read can only have
    lines of the following types or else the program will abort with an
    error message:

    1. single qubit rotations (HAD2, SIGX, SIGY, SIGZ, ROTX, ROTY,
    ROTZ or ROTN with no controls)

    2. simple CNOTs (SIGX with a single True control). Call them c->t=(
    c, t) if c is the control and t the target. (c, t) must be allowed
    by 'c_to_tars'.

    3. NOTA or PRINT lines. PRINT lines are commented out.

    If you have an English file that contains lines that are more
    complicated than this (because, for example, they contain rotations with
    one or more controls attached, or because a CNOT is not allowed
    according to 'c_to_tars'), you can use the expander classes
    CGateExpander, DiagUnitaryExpander, MultiplexorExpander,
    and ForbiddenCNotExpander to expand the circuit to an equivalent albeit
    longer circuit that satisfies constraints 1, 2, 3.

    This class can handle a chip with any number of qubits.

    This class halts execution if it encounters a CNOT that is disallowed
    according to the input 'c_to_tars'. 'c_to_tars' varies with chip. Some
    'c_to_tars's are listed in the files 'chip_couplings_...' found in same
    folder as this file. If c_to_tars = None, the class assumes any CNOT is
    possible.

    all_var_nums : list[int]
        a list of all distinct numbers of the variables encountered in circuit
    aqasm_name : str

        English file.
    c_to_tars : dict[int, list[int]]
        a dictionary mapping j in range(num_qbits) to a list, possibly empty,
        of the physically allowed targets of qubit j, when j is the control
        of a CNOT. If c_to_tars = None, the class assumes any CNOT is
        possible.
    file_prefix : str
    num_qbits : int
    qbtr_wr : SEO_writer
        A SEO_writer object created iff write_qubiter_files is True.

    write_qubiter_files : bool
        The class always writes an AnyQasm text file based on the input
        English file that is read. Iff this is True, the class also writes
        English and Picture files in 1-1 line correspondence with the output
        AnyQasm file
