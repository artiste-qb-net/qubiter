class ChipCouplingsFitter:
    """
    Recall that an undirected graph G is defined as a pair of sets (V, E),
    where V is a set of vertices, and E, the edges, is a set of tuples (c,
    t), where c and t are in V. For undirected graphs, the order of c and t
    is ignored.

    This class reads an English file in order to build a list of the CNots
    used in the file. The CNots in the list are specified as (c, t) tuples.
    Then the class builds an undirected graph, call it GE=(V_GE, E_GE) for
    Graph_English, from that CNots list. Then the class builds another
    graph, call it GP=(V_GP, E_GP) for Graph_Physical, from the c_to_tars
    describing the couplings of a particular chip. Then the class uses the
    python networkx function for finding "graph isomorphisms" between
    undirected graphs. The class attempts to find a map phi() from the
    vertices of GE to the vertices of GP, so that phi(x_GE) is a subset of
    x_GP with x=V, E. If the search for phi() succeeds, then phi induces a
    permutation map, call it bit_map: range(num_qbits)->range(num_qbits),
    bit_ge->bit_gp, of the qubits of the circuit from which GE was
    assembled. Under this permutation, the CNots of the permuted circuit are
    all allowed** by the chip constraint c_to_tars. In that sense, the map
    bit_map() is a "fit" to the chip couplings.

    **except, some CNots may have to be reversed (control and target
    swapped) using Hadamards. These reversals can be performed with the
    class ForbiddenCNotExpander.

    Attributes
    ----------
    bit_map: list[int]
        bit_map[bit_ge] = bit_gp defines a map from the bits bit_ge
        of the graph GE to the bits bit_gp of the graph GP.

        Constructor

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_prefix : str
            file prefix of English file which is to be read to assemble
            a list of CNots used in the file.
        num_qbits : int
            Number of qubits used in English file with file prefix
            `file_prefix`. IMP: We assume that c_to_tars refers to a chip with
            num_qbits too. Both the English file and the chip must have the
            same number of qubits. This is no loss of generality. As long as
            the English file doesn't mention qubit positions >= num_qbits,
            all you have to do to conform is to change the name of the
            English file so that it claims to pertain to num_qbits qubits.
        c_to_tars : dict[int, list[int]]
            a dictionary mapping j in range(num_qbits) to a list, possibly
            empty, of the physically allowed targets of qubit j, when j is
            the control of a CNOT.
