class Tree(SEO_writer):
    """
    This class creates a binary tree of nodes whose cargo is contained in
    the attributes of class Node. This class, being a child of class
    SEO_writer, is also capable of writing English & Picture files. After
    creating a binary tree, it proceeds to use that tree to produce a CS
    decomposition of the unitary matrix init_unitary_mat that is fed into
    its constructor. This CS (cosine-sine) decomp consists of a sequence of
    diagonal unitaries (DIAG lines in English file) and multiplexors (MP_Y
    lines in English file) whose product equals init_unitary_mat.

    If you wish to expand DIAG and MP_Y lines into cnots and single qubit
    rotations, use DiagUnitaryExpander and MultiplexorExpander classes.

    The CS decomposition was a famous decomp of Linear Algebra well before
    quantum computing. It was first applied to quantum computing in the 1999
    paper and accompanying C++ program cited below. Much of the code of the
    original C++ Qubiter has been rewritten in Python for the new pythonic
    Qubiter.

    Let init_unitary_mat be N dimensional, with N = 2^n, where n = number of
    qubits. A general N dimensional unitary matrix has N^2 dofs (real
    degrees of freedom). That's because it has N^2 complex entries, so 2*N^2
    real parameters, but those parameters are subject to N real constraints
    and N(N-1)/2 complex constraints, for a total of N^2 real constraints.
    So 2N^2 real parameters minus N^2 real constraints gives N^2 dofs.

    (a) Each DIAG (MP_Y, resp.) line of the CS decomp of init_unitary_mat
    depends on N (N/2, resp.) angles and there are about N DIAG and N MP_Y
    lines. So the DIAG lines alone have enough dofs, N^2 of them, to cover
    all N^2 dofs of init_unitary_mat. So clearly, there is a lot of
    redundancy in the CS decomp used by Qubiter. But, there is hope: the CS
    decomp is not unique, and it might be possible to choose a CS decomp
    that makes zero many of the angles in the DIAG and MP_Y lines. Some of
    those "compiler optimizations" are considered in references below.

    (b) The CS decomp as used here leads to order N^2 = 2^{2n} cnots and
    qubit rotations so it is impractical for large N. But for small N,
    it can be useful. For large N, it might be possible to discover
    approximations to individual MP_Y and DIAG lines. An approximation of
    this type is considered in MultiplexorExpander.

    Clearly, there is much room for future research to improve (a) and (b).
