       "The word \"Placeholder\" is used in Qubiter (we are in good company, Tensorflow uses this word in the same way) to mean a variable for which we delay/postpone assigning a numerical value (evaluating it) until a later time. In the case of Qubiter, it is useful to define gates with placeholders standing for angles. One can postpone evaluating those placeholders until one is ready to call the circuit simulator, and then pass the values of the placeholders as an argument to the simulator’s constructor. Placeholders of this type can be useful, for example, with quantum neural nets (QNNs). In some QNN algorithms, the circuit gate structure is fixed but the angles of the gates are varied many times, gradually, trying to lower a cost function each time.\n",
